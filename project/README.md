This project consists of a side-scrolling shoot'em up style game made in Lua. Titled SunPiercer, the game revolves around a spaceship, which the player controls, being attacked by an endless hoard of star-like monsters.
The game is played using a keyboard, with the arrow keys being used to control the spaceship and the spacebar used to fire a bullet forward. Additionally, pressing enter during the game will let you pause and unpause, while pressing escape anytime will close the game.
Each level contains a certain number of enemies which must be defeated in order to make progress. Upon completing a level, the player is given the option to upgrade one of the spaceship's qualities, either its bullet power (atk), its total amount of health (hp), or it's speed (spd). As you progress through levels, the enemies will steadily increase in difficulty, and certain levels will contain special boss enemies. The game is endless, since the levels are procedurally generated, so the game only ends when your hp is reduced to 0. Your hp decreases every time an enemy manages to hit you.
